						&ldquo;Guys, guess what?&rdquo; yelled Quinn as she walked into VISION headquarters with Lana at her side. <br>

						&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Eve appeared in the hallway. &ldquo;Do I need schedule an emergency briefing?&rdquo; she demanded.<br>

						&ldquo;No, silly, we don’t have anything scheduled right now. I want to show you guys something that Lana and I found,&rdquo; the older girl replied. 
						She led the other VISION members to a locked room, and entered a string of digits to let herself in. 
						Together, the girls walked up to the central desk, only to realize that the computer there wasn’t set up.<br>

						&ldquo;Aw, man!&rdquo; Quinn said at the realization. &ldquo;We’ll have to boot it to show you guys our discovery. 
						I don’t want to use another computer, this needs to be secure.&rdquo;<br>

						In order to boot the computer, we plugged one of the two black cables into the system unit. 
						Then, we plugged the orange extension cord into a wall outlet, so that we could connect the computer into an outlet. 
						Next, we connected the black cable to the power bar, which connected to the extension cord. 
						After this, we placed the monitor on top of the system unit and used the VGA cable to connect the system unit and the monitor. 
						Then we used the second black cord in the monitor and we turned on the power bar. 
						We found that the system unit turned on, but the monitor only displayed &ldquo;Entering Power Save,&rdquo; and then shut off. <br>

						We concluded that three things could have been the problem&colon; 
						a) the monitor was not working, b) the system unit was not working, or c) the VGA cable, connecting the system unit to the display on the monitor, was not working. 
						We retrieved a new VGA cable, and replaced the old one. We tried again, but the result was the same. 
						Next, we replaced the monitor&semi; however, the attempt was unsuccessful once again. 
						Finally, we replaced the system unit with a different one, and reconnected the cables, our fingers crossed for success. 
						Thankfully, this time it worked! <br>

						Lana then logged on to her account, her fingers blurring as they typed so quickly. 
						She then fished a USB stick out of her pocket, and plugged into the computer. 
						Once its files were uploaded onto the computer, she wiped the flash drive and placed it back into her pocket. 
						In the meantime, Eve went ahead and clicked the first file, opening up a thirty-page document, its title in bold black lettering.<br>

					<p>
						VISION recovered pages of Damien E. Prave’s personal journal, and combined it with our security footage and deleted emails to piece together the events 
						leading up to June 1st, 2018. We’ve chosen to make them available to the public. 
						<br>
						April 3rd, 2016
						<br>
						Fame isn’t what I expected it to be. I always knew I would be famous&mdash; thanks to my now-estranged father, Edgar Prave, I knew what it would be like. 
						Paparazzi, travelling, stress. It was what he was made of. Yet, he never told me about how breathtaking it would be.
						<br>
						At the time I believed that he spoke only of the downfalls of fame because that's all he experienced. 
						I now know that it was rather because he didn't want to be surpassed by me. Yet despite his discouragement, I still found the attention and the money irresistible. 
						Now that I have become a world-class actor, it's opened doors I never even thought existed. No, I’m not talking about perspective, opportunity, and such, I’m talking about power. 
						People will bend to my every will and take in my every word! Frankly, it’s frightening, but I admit that I do like it.
						<br>
						However, it makes me wonder about the sanity and stability of our society. How much longer can we last as a population if people listen and base their actions upon 
						someone they idolize, just because they’re famous? It’s, well, odd at best&mdash;and at worst, a sign that humanity is doomed.
						<br>
						D. E. Prave
						<br> <br>
						May 29th, 2018
						<br>
						Ha.
						<br>
						I’ve finally stumbled upon this wretched old journal. It is laughable to look back at the things I believed two years ago. 
						I was stupid and weak. When my fans worshipped me like a god, I saw it as blind devotion. I’ve since realized that it was rather the pursuit of truth. 
						When I spoke, it resonated in their bones. When I demanded, my requests were ones they knew to be right, in their hearts.
						<br>
						Idolizing someone, I see now, isn’t worshipping a figure that you’ve put on a pedestal. Instead, it’s worshipping a figure that was already on a pedestal, 
						because they are simply right. They speak truth and know what is s best. 
						<br>
						I, Damien Edgar Prave, know what is best.
						<br>
						D. E. Prave
						<br><br>
						May 30th, 2018
						<br>
						I’ve been using my influence to accomplish some… let’s say goals. Ever since my childhood, I've yearned to become not only 
						famous but better and more powerful than my father had ever been. I must prove to him that I’m not just a copy of him. The only way to do this&mdash;to 
						rise above my father's legacy and shield the world from his vicious arrogance&mdash;is to become greater than him, in any and every possible way. 
						I accept bribes, deals, and I don't weaken myself by following a moral code. If that makes me corrupt, then so be it, but I disagree. It makes me unstoppable. 
						I am simply doing what needs to be done.
						<br>
						However, as of late, there has been fishy behaviour all around me. It's subtle. A colleague's mannerisms change in the slightest or a manager’s suspicious stares 
						in the corner of my eye. I don't have the time to worry about trivial things, but I am beginning to think that this may not be so insignificant.
						<br>
						D. E. Prave
						<br><br>
						May 30th, 2018 (Later)
						<br>
						Someone is onto me.
						<br><br>
						May 31st, 2018
						<br>
						I was awake all night talking to my agents, sorting out this business. We’ve hardly gotten anywhere. 
						I received an e-mail from an anonymous address warning me of a computer containing information about me. 
						It could expose the things that I do that I know are right, but society would condemn me for. All this information must be destroyed as soon as possible. 
						<br>
						From noreply&commat;vision.org <br>
						To dprave&commat;prave.com
						<br>
						I can’t tell you who I am. But you must know this: there is a computer that exists. 
						On it, is incriminating evidence of illegal activities done by you. It is located in a directory called &ldquo;SUBJECT 141.&rdquo; 
						The files range from videos of violent encounters to e-mails mentioning bribery. The owners of this computer are planning to release them on the Internet in a few days.
						<br>
						I believe that the data were falsified; however, there is no way for that to be proven. You’ll need to destroy the hard drive to get rid of the evidence. 
						Also, there are bugs with cameras and microphones that connect to the organization’s WAN network, and they’re hidden all over the room where the computer is kept, 
						and even within its system unit. You’ll need to dismantle the computer’s hardware, find the hidden cameras, and destroy them, if you don’t want to be caught. 
						I wish you the best of luck.<br>
						<br><br>
						<b>The following description was supplied by Mavis and Lana of VISION, based on technological knowledge and security cameras that captured the incident.</b>
						<br>
						It is unconfirmed how Prave made it past VISION’s security measures, located the cameras, 
						and figured out which computer contained the information about him, but it is extremely likely that he 
						had assistance from the same person who sent the above email.
						<br>
						He was first caught on camera upon entering the room where the computer was located. 
						The cameras immediately notified all members of VISION via our network that there was an intruder. 
						We immediately began rushing to Headquarters, but we were all far away, so it would be awhile before we got there. 
						Once Prave was inside, he seemed to immediately know where all the cameras in the room were. He was uncannily strong, and 
						proceeded to rip all the cameras out of their hiding spots with his bare hands, and placed them upon the floor.
						He then would stamp down on the device, crushing it. However, he had missed a camera with a microphone&mdash;only one, 
						but the mistake would come to haunt him for eternity. Again, he seemed to know right away which computer to target.
						<br>
						He began to disassemble the computer. He unplugged all the cables connecting the monitor, the system unit, and the 
						electrical outlet (4566, 4618, 4674, 4680 *not in order). He moved the monitor out of the way and sat down, 
						as he pulled at a black tab on the system unit, allowing him to remove the cover (4690, 4691). He disconnected a large orange cable 
						(4753) and a series of black, red and orange wires (4762), from the optical drive. The optical drive (4798) is used to read or write 
						information by way of light, and puts information into a computer; as such, it is a type of input device. 
						Prave then pulled at a metal tab and was able to remove the optical drive (4758). Then, he pushed two blue tabs towards each other, 
						releasing the disc drive (4767, 4800), which is a peripheral, since despite its location within the system unit, it is not one of the core 
						elements of the computer: the CPU, RAM, and ROM. Unknown to Prave, it was responsible for permanent secondary storage, and the files he was 
						after were stored there. He cast it aside without a second thought. 
						<br>
						He then disconnected the large blue cable and several colourful wires (4770) from the disc drive. He disconnected the colourful wires (4794) 
						from the motherboard. He then removed thick blue and orange cables from the motherboard, and the black and yellow cables as well. 
						He loosened the screws from the side of the heatsink, which helps regulate the computer’s temperature. He lifted and removed the heatsink. 
						He loosened the screws from the plastic black bar which was holding the heatsink in place, and removed the black bar. 
						He pulled out the black, red, blue, and yellow wires which were twisted together, and pulled out the similarly twisted white, green, and red wires. 
						Afterwards, he removed the screws from the outside of the system unit that held the power supply in place, and removed the power supply. He pulled out the thick white cable and the yellow wire attached to the motherboard. He removed the screws from the corners of the motherboard, in order to remove it. He then removed the fan, and disconnected a white cable from the inside wall of the system unit. 
						<br>
						Nearing the end, he began to slow down, feeling as if he would not be caught. He removed the screws from the small green plate 
						with USB ports, and removed the adhesive holding down the wires. Finally, he unclipped the black wire from the inside wall of system unit. 
						<br>
						Now, he had emptied the entire system unit of its components. He then began to carefully examine each component, 
						and in doing so eventually found 16 tiny, hidden cameras.  He again crushed them all under his boot. 
						<br>
						Finally, he was done. All that was left to do was figure out where the information was stored… at which point, he realized 
						that he had no idea how computers work or which component he needed. The logical solution, then, was to take all the components with him. 
						He was fairly sure that it wasn’t the monitor, which was responsible for displaying information, not storing it. 
						Just then, he heard footsteps from outside the door. He began to frantically stuff all the hardware elements into his knapsack. 
						However, he didn’t get very far before six girls burst fiercely through the doorway and began to close in on him. He was surrounded.
						<br>
						They demanded he hand them the knapsack, but he refused, fumbling to gather the computer parts and attempting to elbow his way out of the girls’ grasps. 
						Thus began a vicious fight. Although Prave was extraordinarily muscled, he was outnumbered, and the girls were incredibly clever. 
						It was clearly a losing battle for the famous man. Then&mdash;something changed. A tall, blonde girl leaned in…
						<br>
						&ldquo;The disc drive,&rdquo; she whispered. Then, she punched him. &ldquo;Take it and go,&rdquo; she told him. 
						Before he knew it, Prave was hit with another punch and the girl was gone. Despite his slight confusion, he had no hesitation in heeding her instruction. 
						He grabbed the component, and in one last burst of strength, pushed through the girls and ran through the door. 
						He clearly somehow knew how to escape as easily as he had come in. It was over; Prave had the information, and they had failed. 
						<br>
						Then, a redheaded girl turned to the spot where the computer had been, and suddenly, she began to laugh.
						<br>
						&ldquo;What’s so funny?&rdquo; the others demanded. &ldquo;Prave just escaped with all his files!&rdquo;
						<br>
						Eve, the redhead, laughed harder. She pointed a finger towards the leftover hardware. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said. 
						&ldquo;He didn’t even take the right part!&rdquo;
						<br>
						She was right. There it was, sitting next to the empty system unit&colon; the disc drive, in perfect condition.

				<div class="story">
					<p>
						<b>The following description was compiled by VISION by speaking to all the team members, which included the interrogation of Lilith, as well as some creative license.</b> <br>

						That night, none of the team got any sleep. They were all scouring VISION’s intranet, searching for something that would help 
						them understand how Prave was able to access the building at all, let alone find the room and all the cameras. <br>

						Well, Lilith knew; she had helped Prave, of course. However, she needed to find out if there was any footage that would reveal her role in the incident, 
						in order to delete it as soon as possible and wipe any trace of its existence. <br>
						After hours of searching, Lilith finally stumbled across a recording from an old, low-quality camera located in the computer’s room. 
						The team had practically forgotten about it, in favour of the much better cameras located in the same room. She looked over it&mdash;her heart sank as she watched herself 
						mutter instructions to Prave, betraying her team&mdash;and quickly deemed that it needed to be destroyed. She moved her Bluetooth mouse to delete the file, 
						but just as she was about to click it, she was interrupted. 

						The girls didn’t even bother knocking before barging into Lilith’s office and approaching her desk. Lilith tried to hide her panic as she shrunk back from the faces above her. 
						She had never seen any of her friends&mdash;Eve, Lana, Mavis, Nakia, and Quinn&mdash;look at her with so much fury. 

						They all watched each other for a few moments, and then all began to speak at once. Finally, a solemn, commanding voice rose up over the others.

						&ldquo;Lilith, we know what you did.&rdquo;

						Lilith gazed up at the speaker, Quinn, helplessly. To the blonde’s surprise, Quinn did not seem angry&mdash;in fact, she looked rather distraught. 
						It was an expression that conveyed sorrow, disappointment, and even confusion. &ldquo;Quinn&mdash;guys, I&mdash;&rdquo;

						&ldquo;Tell us, Lilith,&rdquo; snapped Mavis. &ldquo;What could possibly justify not only helping a corrupt, evil criminal, but also betraying us all?&rdquo;

						&ldquo;Yeah! What gives you the right to defend yourself?&rdquo;
						&ldquo;You should be ashamed, Lily.&rdquo;

						Then, Lilith had had enough. 
						&ldquo;I thought he was innocent, okay?!&rdquo; she confessed with frustration. &ldquo;It sounds stupid&mdash;I knew you wouldn’t believe me, 
						and that’s why I didn’t tell you. The evidence was so weak compared to our normal standards, so I believed that you guys, or someone, created it. 
						I’ve adored of Damien E. Prave and his films since I was a child. I couldn’t just turn against him like that.&rdquo;

						&ldquo;Lily,&rdquo; sighed Nakia, &ldquo;of course we didn’t show you everything. We knew you were a huge fan, and, well, we thought that hiding the worst of 
						Prave’s secrets would spare you, a little bit. It was wrong of us to keep the whole truth from you.&rdquo;

						&ldquo;However, that doesn’t change your actions,&rdquo; added Eve.

						Lilith sighed. She knew this. &ldquo;Is there any way that I can make it up to you guys?&rdquo;

						The team looked amongst each other, unsure. Lana piped up with a suggestion: &ldquo;How about you help us put the computer back together? 
						Simple, but time-consuming. Just what you hate.&rdquo; She grinned at Lilith.

						Lilith shrugged. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; She smiled appreciatively at her friends&mdash;and what great friends they were.

				<div class="story">
					<p>
						&ldquo;Alright girls, &rdquo; boomed Quinn.  &ldquo;Time to assemble. &rdquo; <br>

						&ldquo;Aye aye, Captain!&rdquo; Nakia replied jokingly. <br>

						&ldquo;Let’s get to it. &rdquo;<br>

						That day, working together in perfect harmony, we assembled that computer faster than we had ever assembled a computer before!<br>

						First, we clipped a black wire to the wall of the system unit. Then, we put screws on a green-coloured component, and connected a white wire to it.
						Next, we clipped the fan back in place, and also placed the motherboard properly on the floor of the system unit. We placed and tightened the 
						screws of the motherboard in order to keep it in place. Then, we plugged a black and white cable with a yellow wire attached to it to the motherboard.<br>

						&ldquo;It looks like a handbag, &rdquo; commented Nakia casually, causing a bout of laughter among the group.<br>

						Then, we placed the power supply in the system unit, and placed and tightened its screws. We plugged in a twisted set of black, red, blue, and 
						yellow wires, and did the same for a set of white, green, and red wires. <br>
						 
						&ldquo;That one looks like a candy cane!&rdquo; Eve pointed out.  &ldquo;I would kill for one of those right now.&rdquo;<br>

						Then, we put in a long black bar, and tightened its screws. Next was the heatsink. We placed that inside the system unit, and we again 
						tightened its screws to hold it in place. A series of black and yellow wires were also plugged into the motherboard, and so were two blue and 
						orange cables. Then, a series of twisted, multi-coloured wires were connected to the motherboard. Then, we fastened a clear plastic tie around 
						the wires to hold them together. We then connected a blue cable to the disc drive, as well as the multi-coloured wires. We pushed two tabs together 
						in order to allow a silver, box-shaped component to be placed in the system unit. Then we lifted a metal tab and slid in the disc drive.<br>

						&ldquo;Last step, guys!&rdquo; Mavis said with a smile.  &ldquo;Let’s do it together.&rdquo;<br>

						We all placed our hands on the system unit’s cover and as Lana slid out the tab which would allow us to place the lid on correctly, 
						we slowly lowered it until it fit perfectly in its place. Now, all that was left to do was boot it, to test that it was working.<br>

						We plugged all the cables in the correct places; one of the black cables was plugged into monitor, and one into the system unit. 
						Both cables then went into the grey power bar, which in turn went into the orange extension cord, which connected to the wall outlet. 
						We then put the monitor on top of the system unit, and carefully connected the VGA cable. We then turned on the system unit—and were rewarded 
						with the screen lighting up. It worked!<br>

						&ldquo;Group hug!&rdquo; Eve declared.<br>

						The girls all hugged one another. &ldquo;To VISION!&rdquo; someone shouted. <br>

						&ldquo;To taking down bad guys!&rdquo; <br>

						&ldquo;To forgiveness.&rdquo;<br>

						&ldquo;To female superheroes!&rdquo;<br>

						&ldquo;We’re not superheroes, Lilith.&rdquo;<br>

						&ldquo;Speak for yourself.&rdquo;<br>

						&rdquo;TO US!&rdquo;<br>
